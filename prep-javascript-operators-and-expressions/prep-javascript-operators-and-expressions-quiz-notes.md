## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data type is returned by an arithmetic operation?
  Number, with the exception of dividing by zero, in which case js returns 'infinity' or '-infinity', also invalid number operations return 'NaN' which means 'not a number.' There is also string concatenation which is adding two or more strings, in which case the operation could return string.

- What is string concatenation?
  It is when multiple strings are joined to become one.

- What purpose(s) does the `+` plus operator serve in JavaScript?
  It could do arithmetic, which would be summation; string concatenation, and unary plus operator, which turns its operand to a number.

- What data type is returned by comparing two values (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc)?
  Boolean.

- What does the `+=` "plus-equals" operator do?
  Shorthand for adding the value of the right operand to the left operand and then assigning the result to the left operand.
